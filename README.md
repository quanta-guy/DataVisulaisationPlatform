##Control, Data Acquisition and Visualization of data from PLC 
Developed a system to remotely control and monitor Siemens S7-1200 PLCs using a Raspberry Pi 3B as a gateway. Utilized Python libraries (Snap7, Pymodbus TCP) to establish Modbus TCP/IP communication. Created a mobile application using Flutter for real-time data visualization and control. Implemented MQTT protocol to reduce latency and improve data transmission efficiency.
Outcome: Remote monitoring and controlling capabilities for industrial automation processes.
